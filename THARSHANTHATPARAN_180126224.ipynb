    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29th September 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lecture we will think a little about 'how we got here' in terms of computer science. In the lecture itself, this will be done by taking a subjective perspective, that of my own 'data autobiography'."

    "## Assumed Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html). "

    "#### Question 1 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Guido van Rossum invented Python during the Christmas holiday in 1989 as a \"hobby\" programming project to keep himself occupied. Taking inspiration from the ABC language, the Python language is able to carry out exemption handling and interfacing with the OS of Amoeba. The name \"Python\" originated from his 'mood' at the time of invention due to his high interests in the comedy group \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The source in Python is compiled into the \"bytecode\" form, where the source written in a high-level language and the \"bytecode\" is written similar to CPU instructions but are executed by 'virtual machine' software. Therefore, Python is a compiled language. However, the language is also designed as an object-oriented language that is capable of creating classes and objects easily like Java. Hence, Python is a multipurpose programming language with multiple programming paradigms.\n",

    "We are working in the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook). It provides an environment for interacting with data in a natural way which is reproducible. We will be learning how to make use of the notebook throughout the course. The notebook allows us to combine code with descriptions, interactive visualizations, plots etc. In fact it allows us to do many of the things we need for data science. Notebooks can also be easily shared through the internet for ease of communication of ideas. The box this text is written in is a *markdown* box. Below we have a *code* box."

The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

    "#### Question 2 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental package used in Python for scietific computing. \n",
    "In the package, it contains an N-dimensional array object, \n",
    "`numpy.ndarray`, integrating tools to integrate C, C++ and \n",
    "Fortran code with the Python code, linear algebra, Fourier transform,\n",
    "and many other capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python 2D plotting library used to create figures and graphs of high quality\n",
    "in a variety of formats like hardcopy and interactive. Can be used in many\n",
    "platforms such as Python shells and the Jupyter notebook. Generates plots,\n",
    "histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc. The\n",
    "\"pyplot\" module resembles the MATLAB interface, especially when using the \n",
    "iPython shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `scipy`\n",
    "\n",
    "A scientific-computing library, comparable to other libraries like GSL and MATLAB's toolboxes, uses the numpy framework for applications such as algebraic operations, interpolation, optimisation, statistics, integration, Fast Fourier transforms, image manipulation, signal processing, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "A library used to \"fill the gap\" in Python's lack of ability to analyse and model data without having to use a domain specific language like R to carry out the data analysis workflow. Mainly used for linear and panel regression, but not much outside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `pylab`\n",
    "\n",
    "A library with the aims of achieving what the other libraries mentioned above are capable of doing. The people working behind this library are currently trying to combine all the libraries mentioned above into one easy-to-use package to avoid complications like conflicting names exported by different modules."

    "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

    "A probability distribution expresses uncertainty about the outcome of an event. We often encode this uncertainty in a variable. So if we are considering the outcome of an event, $Y$, to be a coin toss, then we might consider $Y=1$ to be heads and $Y=0$ to be tails. We represent the probability of a given outcome with the notation:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(Y=0) = 1-P(Y=1) = 0.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities are often defined as the limit of the ratio between the number of positive outcomes (e.g. *heads*) given the number of trials. If the number of positive outcomes for event $y$ is denoted by $n_y$ and the number of trials is denoted by $N$ then this gives the ratio \n",

    "When predicting whether a coin turns up head or tails, we might think that this event is *independent* of the year or time of day. If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as *conditioning*. We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time). Or, often, for a shorthand we use $P(y|t)$ to represent this distribution (the $Y=$ and $T=$ being implicit). Because we don't believe a coin toss depends on time then we might write that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y|t) = p(y).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "However, we might believe that the number of deaths is dependent on the year. For this we can try estimating $P(Y>40 | T=2000)$ and compare the result, for example to $P(Y>40|2002)$ using our empirical estimate of the probability."

    "The estimate made of $P(y|t)$ is a good estimate for the years where movies have more than 40 deaths, but not so good in the years where movies do not have more than 40 deaths as the graphs show a flat zero line when there could be at least a little likely for movies to have more than 40 deaths. At the peaks of the graphs, the probability is equal to 1, which is almost true due to the influence of movies having significantly more deaths than usual in those years of release."

We represent a joint probability using the notation $P(Y=y, T=t)$ or $P(y, t)$ for short. Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002? Or any other question that may occur to us. Again we can easily use pandas to ask such questions.\n"

    "Bayes rule is a very simple rule, it's hardly worth the name of a rule at all. It follows directly from the product rule of probability. Because $P(y, t) = P(y|t)P(t)$ and by symmetry $P(y,t)=P(t,y)=P(t|y)P(y)$ then by equating these two equations and dividing through by $P(y)$ we have\n",

    "which is known as Bayes' rule (or Bayes's rule, it depends how you choose to pronounce it). It's not difficult to derive, and its importance is more to do with the semantic operation that it enables. Each of these probability distributions represents the answer to a question we have about the world. Bayes rule (via the product rule) tells us how to *invert* the probability."

    "\n",
    "80% training data and 20% testing data (e.g. 40,000 films for training and 10,000 films for testing). Ensure that the training data are not leaked to testing data, otherwise prediction would seem more accurate when actually, it may not be the case. Structure the procedure with 'temporal cutoffs' to make sure that the testing data instance remains newer than the training data instance. Use case should be defined for clarity in process: 'Rate new movie from 1 to 10'. Purpose is to auto rate each movie without manual input. Training data requires `IMDB_Rating` and the other variables like `Film`, `Year`, and `Director`. Outcome `IMDB_Rating` is treated as a numerical value to fit into a regression model. The regression model can use typical regression evaluation metrics like mean squared error. Example of metric to be used is 'area under curve' and accuracy of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional distribution should be used as means to predict the `IMDB_Rating`. The distribution should be between `IMDB_rating` given `Year` for example since, old films (before the `Year` of 1960 for instance) were generally rated higher than new films after 1960 (people usually say that \"OLD is GOLD\"). Other distributions can be set like `IMDB_Rating` given `Actors` and `IMDB_rating` given `Director` since `Actors` and `Director` have influences to the watcher's impressions of a movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conditional probabiities that a movie will get a certain value on `IMDB_Rating` should be distributed over a Normal distribution, where the mean and standard deviation determines the shape of the Normal distribution for each case."
